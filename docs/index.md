# Charter Document for 
## Intelligent Immersification in the Metaverse (I²M) ACM Chapter

This document will be used to outline the structure, vision/mission, and activities of the Intelligent Immersion in the Metaverse (I²M) ACM Chapter.

I²M is now an official ACM Virtual Chapter (click "Show Virtual Chapters" at https://www.acm.org/chapters/find-a-chapter)
- note that traditional ACM chapters are geographically based, but virtual chapters are based on a common interest or theme
- we did not tie this to a SIG, as there is no single SIG that covers the intersecting areas

## Overview

The Intelligent Immersion in the Metaverse (I²M) ACM Chapter welcomes individuals passionate about exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and immersive technologies, including research and development across domains of Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, and other related fields.

Our community fosters a collaborative environment that leverages the diverse perspectives of professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in intelligent immersion technologies. We aim to:

* **Curate cumulative knowledge and resource repositories** to support the development and adoption of intelligent immersion technologies.
* **Disseminate knowledge and facilitate the exchange of ideas** through hands-on workshops, technical sharing sessions, and participation at leading conferences like SIGGRAPH, CHI, symposiums like NVAITC and AAAI Symposiums, and other events.
* **Encourage the evolution of methodologies** to keep pace with advancements in intelligent immersion.

By joining us, you can contribute to the growth and innovation of intelligent immersification through our collaborative efforts.

### Background

We started as a tiny group of researchers and practitioners who are passionate about the intersection of AI and immersive technologies. As we recognized the potential of this cross-polination, we decided to organize something more formal to bring together like-minded individuals to explore and share our thoughts on the future of this idea:
- We started an "AI x Metaverse" track in the AAAI 2023 Summer Symposium, and garnered the highest number of submissions resulting in a full-day workshop that was the most attended track
- We followed that up with a "AI x Metaverse" BoF session at SIGGRAPH Asia 2023, which also enjoyed (more than) a full house
- Then we finally inaugurated I²M at SIGGRAPH Asia 2024!

## Mission and Vision

**Mission:**

The I²M ACM Chapter's mission is to:

* **Empower individuals** to explore and leverage intelligent immersion technologies in the metaverse.
* **Advance the field** by fostering knowledge sharing, collaboration, and innovation.
* **Bridge the gap** between research and practical applications within the metaverse.

**Vision:**

The I²M ACM Chapter aspires to be a leading force in shaping the future of the metaverse by spearheading workshops, symposiums, and collaborative research initiatives that drive the integration of AI and immersive technologies.

## Membership

Membership in the I²M ACM Chapter is open to individuals who share an interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and immersive technologies. Members are encouraged to actively participate in the community by:

* **Contributing to knowledge sharing:** Share insights, research findings, and resources related to intelligent immersion technologies.
* **Participating in events:** Attend workshops, technical sessions, and conferences to stay updated on the latest trends and advancements.
* **Collaborating on projects:** Engage in collaborative projects that explore the application of AI in immersive environments.

Membership will be managed through the ACM's official membership platform, and members will be required to adhere to the [ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).

Unofficially, we will also maintain a Discord server for community members to engage in discussions, share resources, and collaborate on projects.

To maintain I²M as an ACM Chapter, we will need to have at least a Chair, Vice-Chair and Treasurer. We will also need to have at least 10 ACM members in good standing to start the chapter.

## Officers and Leadership

The I²M ACM Chapter will be led by a team of Chapter Officers who will oversee the community's activities and initiatives. The officer roles and responsibilities are as follows:
- **Chapter Chair:** Responsible for overseeing the chapter's operations, setting strategic goals, and coordinating activities
- **Chapter Vice-Chair:** Assists the Chapter Chair in their duties and takes on additional responsibilities as needed
- **Chapter Treasurer:** Manages the chapter's finances, including budgeting, fundraising, and financial reporting
- **Chapter Secretary:** Handles administrative tasks, maintains records, and manages communication with members (this role may be combined with the Treasurer role)
- 

The current Chapter Officers are:
- Chapter Chair: TAN Chek Tien (Singapore Institute of Technology)
- Chapter Vice-Chair: NG Aik Beng (NVIDIA)
- Chapter Treasurer: Indriyati ATMOSUKARTO (Singapore Institute of Technology)
- Chapter Secretary: Megani RAJENDRAN (NVIDIA)
- Chapter Membership Chair: Yethoven TUKIMIN (Meta)
- Chapter Web Chair: Jeannie LEE (Singapore Institute of Technology)

More details on the roles and responsibilities of the officers can be found in the [chapter-in-a-box-professional](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/chapters/chapter-in-a-box-professional.pdf) guide provided by the ACM.

## Meetings and Activities

The I²M ACM Chapter will organize regular meetings and activities to engage members and foster collaboration within the community. We primarily aim to conduct these activities at leading conferences and symposiums. Some of the key activities we plan to organize include:

### I²M XY PLANE (in short I²M XY):

The I²M XY series focuses on foundational topics and essential development skills within I²M. In computer graphics, the X-Y plane is where basic structures and concepts are first laid out. Similarly, these sessions are designed to build a solid foundation for understanding and working with immersive technologies.

These will typically take the form of online knowledge sharing sessions, and could also take place in person at conferences like ACM CHI and SIGGRAPH (Asia) Courses or BoFs.

### I²M Z-AXIS (in short I²M Z):

The I²M Z seminars focus on exploring advanced, state-of-the-art topics within I²M. Just as the Z-axis in computer graphics represents depth, these seminars delve into the deeper complexities required to push the boundaries of research and development. This series will foster collaboration and discourse on cutting-edge developments at the intersection of AI, HCI, and related areas within metaverse technologies.

These will typically take the form of curated I²M workshops, e.g., ACM CHI Workshops and SIGGRAPH Panels, and may also include adhoc online seminars.

## Finances

The I²M ACM Chapter will operate on a non-profit basis and will rely on funding from the community and external sponsors to support its activities. Specific sources of funding will be determined at a later stage.

All ACM Chapters collect and disburse their own funds for the normal operations of the chapter. A financial report will be prepared annually and shared with the ACM to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of the chapter's finances.
